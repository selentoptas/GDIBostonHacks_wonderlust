# GDIBostonHacks_wonderlust
wonderlust is a mobile platform for a new experience where young adults can discover new local experiences, select single or multi day 
trips, find travel companions, and share transportation costs. This is our idea as a team for GDI Boston Hackathon at this weekend. There 
were four prize categories: Best in Show, Best UX/UI, Best Tech, and Best Voice UX. Our team won Best UX/UI!
